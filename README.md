This is an analysis using SQL of the DVD company Rockbuster Stealth LLC created by CareerFoundry for their Data Anaylytics course.
## Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that is looking into online video rental services with their movie licenses in order to keep up with competition from Netflix and Amazon Prime.

## Resolution
First I used SQL queries to sort total rentals of customers by there country by joining tables for customer adresses and customer orders to see the top ten countries by total revenue. Next I by using the customer identification table joined with the customer order and address tables I found the top five customers by total money spent. Next I then joined the movie id table with the orders table to see the top ten movies by revenue and what their rating was.
After the data was gathered I then used Tableau to create Map chart to show the top ten countries by revenue. Then I used a tree map to show the top five customers by their names, location, and how much they have spent. Finally I created a bar chart for the top ten movies by revenue and their rating. These charts were used to help build a marketing strategy for RockBuster.
